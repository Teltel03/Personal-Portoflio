        Anita Magsaysay-Ho was a Filipino painter best known for her Social Realist and post-Cubist portrayals of Filipino life and 
        culture, notably and frequently portraying groups of women engaged in labor. Born on May 25, 1914 in Manila, the Philippines,
        Magsaysay-Ho studied under Fernando Amorsolo at the University of the Philippines' School of Fine Arts before moving to the 
        United States to study at the Cranbrook Academy in Michigan. Her work centered around the central tenets of Modernism, garnering 
        her inclusion in the Filipino artist group the Thirteen Modernsâ€”the only woman to do so. Magsaysay-Ho received significant 
        critical acclaim and recognition for her work before her death on May 5, 2012, including first prize at the Philippine Art 
        Association in 1952. Her work can be found among the collections of institutions like the Metropolitan Museum of Manila, and 
        the Ateneo Art Gallery in Manila, Philippines.
